(*
This example defines Extended BNF
informally. Many of the syntax rules include
a comment to explain their meaning; inside a
comment a meta identifier is enclosed in angle
brackets < and > to avoid confusion with
similar English words. The non-terminal symbols
<letter>, <decimal digit> and <character> are
not defined. The position of <comments> is
stated in a comment but not formally defined.
